# AsteroidSeeker
Constructed Android Studio app with Java to create a working game with sound and animations, ImageView, updating UI, and user play in the span of five days (self-taught skills in AS to go beyond of what was required). Thus resulting in receiving a grade of 105% on our project. Collaborated with partner to monitor workflow through Git while efficiently resolving merge conflicts. Ensured work was aesthetically pleasing and code was constantly refactored. This game is inspired by Minesweeper, user detects all the asteroids by clicking buttons and reveals the asteroid that was found. The button grid will update how many asteroids are left in each row or column with the goal being clicking/scanning for asteroids with a well informed decision. In the options you can choose how big you want your rows and columns as well as how many asteroids you want to find.
